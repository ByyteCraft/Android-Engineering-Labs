# Android Engineering Labs

### Google Developer Groups_Android @Masinde Muliro University


## Introduction

Welcome to **Android Engineering Labs**, the official collaborative learning repository for GDG Android – Masinde Muliro University.

This repository serves as our **innovation playground**, **learning archive**, and **engineering growth tracker**. Every session, experiment, architectural discussion, hands-on lab, and scalable Android solution we build lives here.

We don’t just attend Android sessions — we **engineer experiences**, build production-grade thinking, and grow together as Android professionals.


## Purpose of This Repository

This repository exists to:

* Document all Android learning sessions and code labs
* Provide hands-on practical implementations from our meetups
* Track progress across topics and engineering levels
* Enable collaboration between members
* Encourage architecture-first thinking
* Promote scalable and maintainable Android development practices

It is both a **learning timeline** and a **technical growth journal** for our community.
